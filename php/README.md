# Introduction
This is the official PHP driver for the [Mapbox API](https://www.mapbox.com/developers/api/). It is crafted with artisanal skill from native hardwoods.

The PHP driver currently supports geocoding, reverse geocoding, and permanent geocoding APIs.  Others follow.

# PHP Specifics 

## Dependencies
* PHP >=5.1.2 is required. 
* The php5-curl module is required. 
* SPL is required for autoloading.
* JSON is required.  Some distributions as of PHP 5.5rc2 lack the previously included JSON extension due to a license conflict.  Use <tt>sudo apt-get install php5-json</tt>.

## Autoloading
All classes are autoloaded.  Just <tt>require_once("Mapbox.php")</tt> and you're laughing.

The PHP <tt>__autoload()</tt> method is deprecated; this library uses <tt>spl_autoload_register()</tt>.  The Mapbox Autoload will not mess with other libraries or frameworks.

# Getting Started

## Get a Mapbox Token
[Register with Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/signup/) for free access to most Mapbox services.  Go to the [API Token page](https://www.mapbox.com/studio/account/tokens/) to get or create an API token.

## Test Your Integration and Environment
Run <tt>test.php</tt> on the *command line*: 

	'php test.php <yourMapboxToken> [logfile]'
	
On windows remember to use the <tt>-f</tt> switch:
	
	'php -f test.php <yourMapboxToken> [logfile]'  

This checks your PHP install environment and performs a number of unit tests. The script takes your token as parameter one, and an optional output file as parameter two. By default the test echoes to stdout.

## Using the Driver
Require the file 'Mapbox.php, and instantiate a <tt>mapbox</tt> object with the token as parameter'

```php    
	//setup
	require_once('Mapbox.php');
	$mapbox = new Mapbox("<yourMapboxToken>");
```
The driver creates an authenticated handle to Mapbox and configures class loading on instantiation, so be sure to always instantiate a Mapbox object first.

## Geocode Example

(Remember, first create a Mapbox object as we've done above.)
```php
    	//geocode
    	$address = "149 9th St, San Francisco, CA 94103";
    	$res = $mapbox->geocode($address);
    	//view results for debugging
	print_r($res->getData());
```	

You can add the `types` and `proximity` parameters:
```php
	//types
	$types = array('region','place');
	$res = $mapbox->geocode($address, $types);
```
or

```php
	//proximity
	$proximity = array('longitude'=>-122,'latitude'=>37);
	$res = $mapbox->geocode($address, "", $proximity);
```
## Reverse Geocode Example

```php
	//reverse geocode
	$longitude = -122;
	$latitude = 37;
	$res = $mapbox->reverseGeocode($longitude, $latitude);
   	//view results for debugging
	print_r($res->getData());
```

You can use the `types` parameter with reverse geocoding too, effectively giving you a form of point-in-polygon of different geography types:
```php
	//types
	$types = array('postcode');
	$res = $mapbox->reverseGeocode($longitude, $latitude, $types);
```
Pro Tip: longitude always comes before latitude in parameter order, except when it doesn't.

Permanent Geocoding requires specific authentication from Mapbox, so it's a different method:

```php
    	//permanent geocode
    	$address = "149 9th St, San Francisco, CA 94103";
    	$res = $mapbox->geocodePermanent($address);
    	//view results for debugging
	print_r($res->getData());
```	

Unnecessary Reminder: we use <tt>print_r()</tt> in these examples so you can review the output visually.  Obviously, but worth a reminder nonetheless, you do not want to use <tt>print_r()</tt> in production.  

## Working with Results

The response object is an iterator, so you can iterate on it directly:

```php
	//iterate
	foreach ($res as $key => $value){
		//do something with each result
		print_r($value);
	}
```
You can also just get the results as an array:

```php
	$results = $res->getData();
	print_r($results);
```

## Debugging and Metadata

A boatload of tools are available in the driver to help you understand your request, and what the server is (or is not) returning.  Putting the mapbox object in debug mode will dump a ton of metadata to stdout on each query:

```php
	$mapbox->debug();
```

and a wealth of other metadata is available via the response object outside debug mode:

```php
	//was the request successful?
	$success = $res->success();
	
	//get result count
	$count = $res->getCount();
	
	//get http status code: 200, 404, etc.
	$code = $res->getCode();
	
	//get server headers (including rate-limit information)
	$headers = $res->getHeaders();
	
	//get request metadata
	$request - $res->getInfo();
	
	//get attribution
	$attribution - $res->getAttribution();
	
```
